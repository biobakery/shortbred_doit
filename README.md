This repository contains code for creating synthetic metagenomes for the ShortBRED 2015 paper. Please note that it contains a modified version of GemSim, created by McElroy, Luciani, and Thomas (2012) http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/13/74 . I made a slight modification to GemReads.py to make it easier to access the bacterial genomes, which were downloaded from KEGG. 

The ARDB files were downloaded from:
